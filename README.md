## Exercises

### 01 - Hello Blockchain World
- **Task**: In this first exercise, you will become familiar with the basics of smart contract development. The goal is to create a simple smart contract. You will then compile, test, and deploy this smart contract in the local network environment, and subsequently deploy it to the live blockchain.

### 02 - Decentralized Voting System
- **Task**: In this exercise, you will implement a decentralized voting system on the blockchain. This will be a simple smart contract that allows address owners to vote for individual candidates and subsequently display the voting results. The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the basics of the Solidity language.

## Getting Started
