# Smart Contracts Exercise 09: Vulnerabilities Detection --- Solution

The solution to Exercise 09 can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/radovluk/Smart-Contract-Exercise/tree/main/09-Vulnerabilities-Detection/solution/solution-code). There you will find test suites for both the PiggyBank and SimpleDEX contracts. Note that you may develop different invariants from those provided, which is perfectly acceptable as long as they make sense in the context of the contract logic. While it would be possible to add more tests to cover additional functionality, we've kept the exercise relatively simple. (Also, the contracts used for testing are simplified toy examples rather than production-ready implementations).
